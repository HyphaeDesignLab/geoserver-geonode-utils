    Usage examples:
    
        upload.sh some/path/to/file.shp
        upload.sh some/path/to/dir
        upload.sh some/path/to/dir some/path/to/second/file.shp
        upload.sh shp=some/other/file.zip
        upload.sh some/other/zipfile-without-type-prefix.zip   zip-type=shp|geojson|tif
                 
        directory: 
           all immediate children files in a directory will uploaded as INDIVIDUAL datasets
        file: 
            a file and its requisite (associated) files will be uploaded as ONE dataset
            associated files for:
            .shp:  .sld (style), .shx, .dbf, .prj, and .xml
            .geojson:  .sld (style)
            .tif:  .sld (style)
            associated files must be in the same directory and have the same file basename:
              some/dir/file.shp some/dir/file.sld ...
        ZIP archives:
            will be unzipped to a temporary location and individual files uploaded as ONE dataset
            need to tell the uploader script what type of data they contain by
               prefixing it like this "shp=some/archive.zip        OR
               adding an extra argument "zip-type=<type>" to treat ALL encountered ZIP archives as <type>
               ELSE, the script will prompt you to ask what type the ZIP archive is

        multiple ZIP archives in a directory:
            we need to tell the uploader script what type of ZIP archives' data in the directory by:
               adding an extra argument "zip-type=<type>"
               ELSE, the script will prompt you to ask what type the ZIP archive is
