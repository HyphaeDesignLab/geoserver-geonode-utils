Log into GeoServer container
docker exec -it geoserver4hyphae bash

Installed GDAL dependencies prior to installing GDAL. They include:
libroj-dev - PROJ library required by GDAL for peojection and transformation computations
libgeos-dev - It implements the OGC Simple Features geometry model and provides all the spatial functions in that standard and core dependency of PostGIS, QGIS, GDAL, Shapely etc.
swig - wrapper convering variables of GDAL's C API to Java (for GeoServer) and / or Python and store it into variables of another and vice versa

Installation done via the following command
apt install libproj-dev libgeos-dev swig

Downloaded GDAL version (source binaries) same as one being used in GeoServer, in this case version 3.2.2
wget https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/releases/download/v3.2.2/gdal-3.2.2.tar.gz

Unzipped the contents in /gdal/ directory in root
tar -xzf gdal-3.2.2.tar.gz

Navigated to directory and configured GDAL with addons on java
./configure --with-java=/usr/local/openjdk-11/

Run make command to build. You can use number of cores in your comp (check using nproc, 4 in this case). Please note that this may take some time.
make -j4

Install GDAL using
make install

Add paths and symbolic links using
ldconfig

Optionally:
make sure `ant` is installed via `apt install ant`

Build SWIG Java specific binaries by navigating into swig/java and running make as previous
cd swig/java/ && make -j4

Install using
make install

Add the follwing variables to startup bash script at ~/.bashrc
export GDAL_BIN=/gdal/gdal-3.2.2/apps/
export GDAL_DATA=/gdal/gdal-3.2.2/data/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/gdal/gdal-3.2.2/swig/java/

Restart geoserver container and check ineractive logs using
docker logs geoserver4hyphae -f
